Write down, on paper or in a text file, an evaluation of the expression double (double 2) by repeatedly expanding
the definition of double and +. You may assume that + behaves as expected.

Is there more than one way of doing this?
First - evaluating the double inside parenthesis and then expanding the outer double.
double (2 + 2) = double 4 = 4 + 4 = 8

Second - expanding all the definitions and then evaluating everything.
double (2 + 2) = 2+2 + 2+2 = 8

Is one way more efficient than the other?
The first case is more efficient as it will use less memory.
