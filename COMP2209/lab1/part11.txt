The class Eq is instantiated by all of the basic types as well as Lists and Tuples built from these.
However, function types are not an instance of the Eq class. Suggest reasons why this is the case.

In order to determine if the output of two functions in equal we would have to compare their outputs which means
applying the functions to the arguments we don't have yet or to find the domain and range of the functions which is not
really practical. We would have to test for every input or use two identical functions that ignore their arguments.
