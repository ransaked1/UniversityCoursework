    "## Lab 4 - Introduction to Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is an introduction to the Tensorflow library, a powerful tool to run machine learning algorithms in Python. The Tensorflow library is the backbone of the exercises you will find in lab 5 and lab 6. Its advantages include flexibility, parallel execution, and being a general framework for computation. On top of that, it is a good entry to put in your CV!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to import the library in Python. Some Python distributions have it included already, if yours does not, you can sidestep the issue and use [Google's Collaboratory environment](https://colab.research.google.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, it can be a good exercise to try and install it on your local machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you created a virtual environment using conda, you need to activate it first. It is a good practice to work with virtual environments. See Lab0 - Setting up your environment for details on doing this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Unix system's you can simply install it by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install tensorflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install Tensoflow 2, which will be used throughout this module. \n",
    "\n",

    "When the number of features and the dataset are large, computing the pseudo-inverse can become computationally expensive. A more efficient approach is gradient descent, which consists in starting from a randomly selected point and slowly creeping toward the solution. Not only this approach is quick, but it generalises well beyond linear methods. In fact, this is the backbone of the many non-linear neural networks and deep learning algorithms that define the current state-of-the-art.\n",
