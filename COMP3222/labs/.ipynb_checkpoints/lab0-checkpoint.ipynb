    "Those of you familiar with other scientific programming environments like MATLAB, Octave or R may recognise the style of working. Those of you that have only programmed in the context of Software Engineering, read this quote from Fernando PÃ©rez, creator of IPython, a foundational block of Jupyter Notebooks: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"A literate computing environment is one that allows users not only to execute commands but also to store in a literate document format the results of these commands along with figures and free-form text that can include formatted mathematical expressions. In practice it can be seen as a blend of a command-line environment such as the Unix shell with a word processor, since the resulting documents can be read like text, but contain blocks of code that were executed by the underlying computational system\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is comprised of cells, that can be of type Markdown. Cells can be executed using the \"Run\" button on the top. If the cell is of type Markdown, Jupyter will convert it into text. We won't be getting into details with Markdowns in this tutorial. Read this external resource later for a full explanation on how to write Markdown cells https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/markdown-in-jupyter-notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cell is of type code, when you press \"Run\" the code you wrote is passed to a Python interpreter that executes it, showing you any result. Contrary to running a Python script on a shell or IDE, variables that you create in the cell are held in memory so you can use them in subsequent cells. This is memory-expensive, but allows the implementation of \"literate computing\" which is very helpful in the context of Data Science and Machine Learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning algorithms, it is often useful to extend the definition of matrix/vector arithmetic operations as a matter of convenience and sometimes of performance. In this example of vector quantization in numpy's documentation (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html#a-practical-example-vector-quantization)\n",

    "  1) Implement the subtraction as a For iteration over the N rows. Very slow.\n",
    "  2) Create a Nx2 matrix copying the 1x2 vector N times to apply regular matrix subtraction. Very memory-consuming.\n",
    "  \n",
    "To solve this problem, numpy introduces the concept of **broadcasting**, i.e.,  the process of reshaping an array of smaller size to make it compatible for operations with arrays of higher dimensions.  You can then conveniently apply the operation on arrays of some shapes that are strictly speaking incompatible, and numpy will take care behind the scenes as efficiently as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback of the convenience is that you have to memorise the broadcasting rules and be aware of when it is being applied to avoid any confusion. Also, in some occasions the application of broadcasting is less efficient, so you may need to test which of the two approaches is more efficient. Finally, convenience is sometimes at odds with readability of the code, especially when operating at higher dimensions    \n",
