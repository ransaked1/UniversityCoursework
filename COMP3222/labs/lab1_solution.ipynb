    "In this week, we will have an overview of how a practical Machine Learning project works. We aim to familiarise you with the general procedure of doing Machine Learning, while encouraging you to develop your critical thinking by asking you some questions now and then. It also provides an introduction to Scikit-learn, an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation, and many other utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a Machine Learning project is not different from a software project, where you might want to go back and forth and tweak something, or roll out the first prototype and improve on it incrementally. Answering the questions will help you understand more, and allow you to come up with an idea for improving the Machine Learning prototype we introduced here.\n",

    "This exercise is based on the one featured in Chapter 2 of the course's text book.  https://southampton.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1347020175. It is simplified in some aspects to fit into two hours of effort, and to fit the structure of the material given in the lectures. We also add a few additional explanations of our own that we believe make things clearer regarding how Scikit works, and some exercises of our own. As an additional activity , you may read the chapter in question and follow along the linked notebook (In Google Colab). There are some bits of it like the Data Pipelines, that we will cover in following weeks.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In any case, it is essential you frame the problem that you will be solving in the business need of the company/customer. Otherwise, you may end up with an accurate an efficient model that is absolutely useless for the people paying your salary.\n",

    "\n",
    "* How the problem is currently solved? The point here is to get a baseline against which compare your model\n",
    "* What kind of training supervision the model will need: is it a supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, or reinforcement learning task? \n",

Currently, a team of experts do it manually, but a recent evaluation found that they were off by 30%.... prompting management to approve your hiring to improve the situation. They would like to start the experiment using census data, that is openly available and includes the per district median house pricing at a given year, plus additional demographic information such as population, median income and median age of the houses.\n",

For example, when they get word a large company is establishing headquarters in a certain district, they predict the population and median income will increase 10% and 5% respectively in 5 years, then, use your model to predict the median house pricing of this \"future state of the district\" to assess if they should buy some houses now to reap benefits in 5 years.

To properly evaluate performance of our Machine Learning algorithm, you should try using all datapoints in your dataset as a test set and make sure that the RMSE is significatly low. This is called 'Cross-Validation.' Try it with our dataset and one Machine Learning model.\n",
