#The ip command has taken over from ipconfig and is powerful - and hence complex! Note this is for Linux only.
#Try these:

#ip a:          short for ip addr - displays all net devices
#ip -br a:      brief summary - very handy as an alias if used a lot
#ip -s link:    gives you stats
#ip link show:  shows details on the link-layer like mac address and mtu
#ip route:      shows the route table - where each subnet is routed
#ip neigh:      shows the neighbours (found through ARP for example)

#Be careful with ip commands that add addresses, routes etc - however rebooting clears manual config
