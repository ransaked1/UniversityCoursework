A system must be specified for the automated purchase of train tickets from a ticket distributor.
It is possible for the traveller to buy single or return tickets to available destinations, as
well as weekly and monthly season tickets. The traveller will interact with the machine to specify
ticket type, select destination, select payment mode (cash or credit card). A ticket purchase
transaction may fail for various reasons: the distributor is out of change, out of ticket paper,
credit card fails to validate, etc.

Scenario:
• The customer selects “Buy weekly card” and is taken to the “Select destinations” screen
• The customer selects a destination and the “Add to Basket” button is enabled.
• The customer selects “Add to Basket” and is taken to the “Basket” screen
• The customer selects “Pay” and is take to the “Select payment type” screen.
• The customer selects “Credit Card” and enters his card
• The distributor validates the card and requests his PIN
• The customer enters a PIN and the distributor validates it by reference to the bank
• The distributor takes payment and returns the credit card to the customer
• The weekly season card is printed and the customer takes it
