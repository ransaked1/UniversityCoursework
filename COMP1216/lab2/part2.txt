Draw a use case diagram for a Train Ticket system. The system includes two actors: a traveller,
who purchases different types of tickets, and a central computer system, which maintains a
reference database for the tariff.
Use cases should include: BuyOneWayTicket, BuyWeeklyCard, BuyMonthlyCard, UpdateTariff.
Also include the following exceptional cases: Time-Out (i.e., the traveller took too long
to insert the right amount), TransactionAborted (i.e., the traveller selected the cancel button
without completing the transaction), DistributorOutOfChange and DistributorOutOfPaper, and
other exception cases that we have from the previous question.
NB: Identify the right abstraction in this example to avoid an unnecessarily complex diagram.
