A system must be specified for the automated purchase of train tickets from a ticket distributor.
It is possible for the traveller to buy single or return tickets to available destinations,
as well as weekly and monthly season tickets. The traveller will interact with the machine to specify
ticket type, select destination, select payment mode (cash or credit card).
A ticket purchase transaction may fail for various reasons: the distributor is out of change,
out of ticket paper, credit card fails to validate, etc.
