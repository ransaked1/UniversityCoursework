Here at ACME Aircraft Company we are proud of the specialist teams that create our futuristic aircraft.
Each team employs both engineers and mathematicians. We know them all by name, and its also important that
we know the specialism of our engineers. The engineers build the planes, but it’s the mathematicians that
make all the calculations. The teams have a codename too. The aircraft are of course made of many thousands
of complex components, and each has its own part number! Our planes are special to us, they each have a model
number, but also an affectionate nickname. Our latest is called the Thunderbus!
