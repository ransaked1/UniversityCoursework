A system must be specified for the automated purchase of train tickets from a ticket distributor.
It is possible for the traveller to buy single or return tickets to available destinations, as well
as weekly and monthly season tickets. The traveller will interact with the machine to specify
ticket type, select destination, select payment mode (cash or credit card). A ticket purchase
transaction may fail for various reasons: the distributor is out of change, out of ticket paper,
credit card fails to validate, etc.

Draw a class diagram representing the information related to the traveller’s basket (allowing
the traveller to buy multiple tickets), tickets, and payment.

• Specify classes, associations and multiplicities.
• Extend the class diagram to include the following information:
– Price of the tickets
– Origin and destination of the tickets
– Date(s) of travel for the tickets
– Amount, date, and type of payment
